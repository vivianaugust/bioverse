Likewise, the dependent variable is the presence or absence of water vapor, called `has_H2O`, which is either 0 or 1. The relationship between these values is parameterized by `a_inner` (the inner edge of the habitable zone in AU), `delta_a` (the width in AU), `f_HZ` (the fraction of HZ planets with H2O), and `df_notHZ` (the fraction of non-HZ planets with H2O *divided by* `f_HZ`). By defining the four parameters in this way, we can easily avoid parameter combinations inconsistent with our hypothesis (such as the fraction of non-HZ planets with H2O being higher than `f_HZ` planets)."
